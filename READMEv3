NOTES:
    Some data may be output to the terminal instead of GUIs, please check terminal
    after processing data to ensure no errors have been thrown.

SUMMARY:
    The genealogy app begins by reading a provided genealogy document, and
    then creating a family tree based on this data. Once the family tree
    has been created, it should provide a number of quality of life features
    to help the user read and navigate the tree, such as the ability to search
    for members of the tree or add new members. Goal is to create an app that
    clearly and easily keeps track.

SCOPE/DEMOGRAPHIC:
    CycleThree.Requirements conscious, with approach of reading in file, searching tree, and
    adding new family members or relationships. Additionally, GUIs will present all data to user
    and collect new data from user.

KNOWN BUGS:
    1. If a new person is not filled out correctly, cannot exit back to edit and have to restart app
    2. Program does not close completely when app is exited
