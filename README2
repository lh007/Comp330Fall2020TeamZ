    See refFiles for UML diagram, requirements document, team meeting notes,
    and use case narrative/model.

SUMMARY:
    The genealogy app begins by reading a provided genealogy document, and
    then creating a family tree based on this data. Once the family tree
    has been created, it should provide a number of quality of life features
    to help the user read and navigate the tree, such as the ability to search
    for members of the tree or add new members. Goal is to create an app that
    clearly and easily keeps track.

SCOPE/DEMOGRAPHIC:
    CycleTwo.Requirements conscious, with approach of reading in file, searching tree, and
    adding new family members. Additionally, GUI will present all data to user.

KNOWN BUGS:
    1. Relationships need to be created for new children/marriages added
    2. Parents, Siblings, and Grandparents cannot be found for P26, P27
        a. FIXED – error in GeneDataBase
    3. Siblings cannot be found for P8. We will address this during Cycle 3.
        a. Should be fixed when new marriages/children added
    4. Only one child, P13, found for P8. P7, P18 and P23 should also be returned
        a. Should be fixed when new marriages/children added
    5. Duplicates, if read in, appear. For example, P9, one of P1's children, is listed twice 
    when getChildren is called for P1. We need to add checks for this.
        a. FIXED, subject to further testing
    6. Children P26 and P27 do not appear for either P9 or P30. Parents P9 and P30 do not appear for
    either child P26 or P27. P26 or P27 are also not registered as siblings.
        a. FIXED – error in GeneDataBase
