SUMMARY:
    The genealogy app begins by reading a provided genealogy document, and
    then creating a family tree based on this data. Once the family tree
    has been created, it should provide a number of quality of life features
    to help the user read and navigate the tree, such as the ability to search
    for members of the tree or add new members. Goal is to create an app that
    clearly and easily keeps track.

SCOPE/DEMOGRAPHIC:
    Requirements conscious, with approach of reading in file, searching tree, and
    adding new family members. Additionally, GUI will present all data to user.

CYCLE 2 IMPROVEMENTS:
    1. Add a search method
    2. Add Person method (and update text file to reflect)
    3. Methods for a Person
        i. Find parents
        ii. Find children
        iii. Find grandparents
        iv. Find siblings
        v. display all known data about a person
    4. Begin graphical implementation (user GUI)
