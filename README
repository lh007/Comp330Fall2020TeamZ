    K. Luck, K. Phillips, K. Taylor, K. Bui, H. Kureishy

SUMMARY:
    The genealogy app begins by reading a provided genealogy document, and
    then creating a family tree based on this data. Once the family tree
    has been created, it should provide a number of quality of life features
    to help the user read and navigate the tree, such as the ability to search
    for members of the tree or add new members. Goal is to create an app that
    clearly and easily keeps track

SCOPE/DEMOGRAPHIC:
    Requirements conscious, with approach of reading in file, searching tree, and
    adding new family members. Additionally, GUI will present all data to user.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
    Functional:
        1. Read in text file of current family tree
        2. Determine if a given person is known to the app
        3. Record spouses after reading in a partnership
        4. Record children and parents given a partnership
        5. Print out data results when reading in file
    Nonfunctional:
        1. Scalability
        2. Reliability (code does not crash)
        3. Testability
        4. Consistency
        5. Usability

USE CASES:
    1. Given a family tree, program should
        i. read in the information
        ii. interpret information
        iii. organize data attributes accordingly
        iv. implement user understandability

CYCLE 2 IMPROVEMENTS:
    1. Add a search method
    2. Add Person method (and update text file to reflect)
    3. Move test code form main to respective Test classes
    4. Methods for a Person
        i. Find parents
        ii. Find children
        iii. Find grandparents
        iv. Find siblings
        v. display all known data about a person
    5. Begin graphical implementation (user GUI)
